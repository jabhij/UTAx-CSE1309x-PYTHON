"""
Write a function named find_gcd that accepts a list of positive integers and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). Your function 
should return 1 as the GCD if there are no common factors between the integers. Here are some examples: 

if the list was

[12, 24, 6, 18]
then your function should return the GCD:
6
if the list was
[3, 5, 9, 11, 13]
then your function should return their GCD:
1
