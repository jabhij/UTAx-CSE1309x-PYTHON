"""
Write a function that takes a string consisting of alphabetic characters as input argument and returns the most common character. Ignore 
white spaces i.e. Do not count any white space as a character. Note that capitalization does not matter here i.e. that a lower case 
character is equal to a upper case character. In case of a tie between certain characters return the last character that has the most 
count
