"""
Write a function named find_mismatch that accepts two strings as input arguments and returns:
0 if the two strings match exactly.
1 if the two strings have the same length and mismatch in only one character.
2 if the two strings do not have the same length or mismatch in two or more characters.

Capital letters are considered the same as lower case letters. Here are some examples:

First string	   Second String  	Function return
Python	         Java	            2
Hello There      helloothere	    1
sin              sink           	2 (note not the same length)
dog	             Dog	            0
