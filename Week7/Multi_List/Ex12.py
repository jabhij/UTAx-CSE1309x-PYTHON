"""
Write a function that accepts two (matrices) 2 dimensional lists a and b of unknown lengths and returns their product.
Hint: Two matrices a and b can be multiplied together only if the number of columns of the first matrix(a) is the same as the number of 
rows of the second matrix(b). Hint: You may import and use the numpy module but your return must be a python list not a numpy array. 
The input for this function will be two 2 Dimensional lists. For example if the input lists are:

a = [[2, 3, 4],
     [3, 4, 5]]
b = [[4, -3, 12],
     [1, 1, 5],
     [1, 3, 2]]
     
Then your function should return their product such as:
[[15, 9, 47], [21, 10, 66]]
