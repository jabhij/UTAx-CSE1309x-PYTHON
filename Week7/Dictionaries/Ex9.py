"""
Write a function that accepts a string which contains a particular date from the Gregorian calendar. Your function should return what 
day of the week it was. Here are a few examples of what the input string(Month Day Year) will look like. However, you should not 'hardcode'
your program to work only for these input!

"June 12 2012"
"September 3 1955"
"August 4 1843" 

Note that each item (Month Day Year) is separated by one space. For example if the input string is:
"May 5 1992"

Then your function should return the day of the week (string) such as:
"Tuesday"
